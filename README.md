#### Introduction:
This project aims to investigate the relationship between energy consumption, weather patterns, energy efficiency, and individual health. By analyzing these factors, we seek to gain insights into the impact of energy consumption on societal well-being and inform strategies for sustainable energy management.

#### Hypotheses:
Weather patterns significantly influence energy consumption, with extreme weather events leading to spikes in energy usage.
Regions with greater amounts of renewable energy being produced have healthier people, both mentally and physically.
There is a correlation between building age and energy consumption, with older buildings often exhibiting higher energy usage.
Machine learning models can predict future changes in energy requirements based on historical data.
Machine learning models can predict the amount of Americans who will be in “fuel poverty” (10% of annual income spent on energy costs) based on historical data.
Improving energy efficiency may be more effective than increasing production in mitigating energy consumption and environmental impacts.


#### Data Sources:
Utilize APIs from energy consumption and utility providers or government agencies.
Building age data from public records.
Global warming data from climate research sources.
Analysis Methods / Visualizations / ETL:
Statistical analysis, correlation tests, and machine learning algorithms (e.g., regression, prediction).
Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes using tools such as SQL, Spark, and Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit).
Data cleaning and aggregation using Python.
Machine learning models (Scikit-learn) for predictions and classifications.
Utilize data visualization tools such as Tableau, Matplotlib, or Plotly.


#### Models:
Model 1: Linear Regression
Objective: Analyze the relationship between weather, energy production/consumption, and housing.


#### Input Features:
Weather data: High/low temperatures by state by month (2010-2020).
Energy production/consumption data.
Housing data: Age, location, insulation, etc.
Outcome: Predict energy production/consumption.

#### Model 2: Machine Learning
Objective: Investigate the correlation between cancer rates and energy type production.
Input Features:
Energy production data by type (Natural Gas, Coal, Renewable).
Outcome: Rates of cancer, particularly lung/bronchial cancer.
